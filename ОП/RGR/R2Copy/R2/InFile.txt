But first, letТs figure out what causes global warming. Climate change is caused by different reasons. There are many factories and power plants that create a lot of heat. That heat increases the overall temperature on Earth. The growing consumption of electricity also worsens the problem. The more we consume, the more heat is coming to the atmosphere, and the warmer it becomes.

But why exactly global warming is a threat? The most dangerous part of the problem is the fact that the heat can reach the North and South Poles. If it happens, thousands of icebergs will start to melt. In the end, the overall water level will increase. Many coastal cities and islands will end up drowned. But there is still hope for mankind.

Global warming can be prevented if we all work together. We should use green energy, the kind of energy that comes from the sources that cause little or no impact on the environment. There are such green energy sources as solar panels, wind power stations and hydroelectric power plants. Some countries already decided to switch completely to alternative power sources by 2040. In conclusion, I would like to say that we are facing this problem for the first time. If we do the right things, we can make our world a better place.
